  Crilla (my buddy) and I take off in search of a place to sleep and find something close by. While eating dinner I get a message via Instagram..."not sure if you are close to Latvia or have already ridden past, as it seems you post after the fact. If we are lucky, we would like to meet you in Riga and possibly do a video with you? The guys from Outduro"<br>With no breakdown, we would have been meeting in Riga that night and passed by and headed out into the country to camp...maybe!<br>...but as fortuitous luck happens I reply we will be in the area tomorrow, the Outduro guys have no idea who the 'we' is so I explain to them, don't need to do that with you guys, and the following morning we head for Riga via the Latvian TET.<br>About 40-50km outside of Riga we are about an hour down a mud track and it turns to sand, off in the distance behind the bike.<br><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-V5LQhxs/0/60e040f0/X2/Finland%20S-09153-X2.jpg" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[​IMG]" data-url="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-V5LQhxs/0/60e040f0/X2/Finland%20S-09153-X2.jpg"><br>We'd ridden about another km into the woods you and the sand got softer and deeper. I told Crilla to stay put so I could go and ride to see how much more there was. We both guessed not much as we were so close to the capital.<br>I rode an additional 2-3km and there was sand as far as I could see, so turned back ad told him..."nope, can't do it, this is the first time I have ever ridden sand and I don't like it" he tells me<br>So we 180 and head back the way we came and as it was ending Crilla decided to have a closer look at the bushes and the ground<br><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-F8sL7LZ/0/2ec7e5d5/X2/Finland%20S-09152-X2.jpg" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[​IMG]" data-url="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-F8sL7LZ/0/2ec7e5d5/X2/Finland%20S-09152-X2.jpg"><br>He'd somehow wrapped his front wheel around a short tree, so we dragged his brand new shiny GSA a little before lifting it<br><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-768pLv5/0/99b4ce27/X2/Finland%20S-09151-X2.jpg" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[​IMG]" data-url="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-768pLv5/0/99b4ce27/X2/Finland%20S-09151-X2.jpg"><br>The <a href="https://outduro.com/" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">Outduro guys</a> (that's a link so you can see these guys, and what they do and if you are in Riga stop in and say hello) were waiting for us and they tell we are headed outside of the city for the night, for the interview, bbq and some fun riding along the way.<br>...and for once I'm not the tall guy of the group!<br><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-6FjRbBp/0/a2c553fd/X5/rtwpaul-in-latvia-X5.jpg" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[​IMG]" data-url="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-6FjRbBp/0/a2c553fd/X5/rtwpaul-in-latvia-X5.jpg"><br>I tell the guys about Crilla not liking the sand, so what they had planned to ride was changed, he pulls me to one side and tells me he feels bad about it because they were excited to meet me and knew nothing about him and now because of him they can't ride with me where they wanted to.<br>I tell him not to worry, everything is good, we are all just guys riding bikes and having fun, there is no one special person here, especially me, a point I always try to get across, all I am is a guy riding a bike nothing more.<br>So a new route is devised it will end at a families house in the woods, and somewhere along the way there will be a few riding shots,, a very unique location, and then onwards for beer...but one of the guys will head off to get some special meat for the burgers.<br>We start with a little 2-track<br><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-Pp5h6CB/0/aa3e73b7/X3/Finland%20S-09159-X3.jpg" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" alt="[​IMG]" data-url="https://photos.smugmug.com/Unlisted/RTW-2021-ALL/n-NkcvL2/Europe/i-Pp5h6CB/0/aa3e73b7/X3/Finland%20S-09159-X3.jpg"><br>Which quickly turns into muddy 2-track, I'm on brand new knobby tires so I have perfect grip and I'm having loads of fun<br><img src="https://advrider.com/f/attachments/screen-shot-2021-10-23-at-2-42-18-pm-png.3258847/" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-23 at 2.42.18 PM.png" class="bbCodeImage LbImage">
